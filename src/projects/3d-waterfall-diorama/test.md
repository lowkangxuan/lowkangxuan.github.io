## Introduction
This Waterfall Diorama was created as part of my Year 2.2 module assignment, 3D Environment, where I was tasked to create this diorama using low-poly models with a waterfall present within the diorama.

## Project Overview
The overview of each individual component of the project.

### Trees and Mushrooms
As I was looking for a <mark>Forest</mark> theme for this diorama, multiple low-poly trees and mushrooms were modeled and not individually textured. Instead, a <mark>simple trimsheet</mark> was used to texture the models based on their UV placement to the trimsheet itself.
