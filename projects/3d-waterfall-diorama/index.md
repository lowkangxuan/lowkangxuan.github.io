## Introduction
This Waterfall Diorama was created as part of my Year 2.2 module assignment, 3D Environment, where I was tasked to create this diorama using low-poly models with a waterfall present within the diorama.

## Project Overview
I will be going through the important aspects of the project as thoroughly as possible.

### Trees and Mushrooms
As I was looking for a <mark>Forest</mark> theme for this diorama, multiple low-poly trees and mushrooms were modeled and not individually textured. Instead, a <mark>simple trimsheet</mark> with flat colours only was used to texture the models based on their UV placement to the trimsheet itself.

### Swaying grass
To make the environment look abit more interesting, I placed multiple grass across the diorama that has a shader that displaces each vertices based on the gradient noise value. The shader itself was made in Unity's shader graph with the help of Brackeys tutorial (link in #Additional Resources).

### Waterfall
The waterfall itself has 2 parts, the shader and the mesh.

Creating the shader itself is pretty straight forward. I simply displaced each vertices based on a gradient noise and created a normal map based on a separate gradient noise using the `Normal From Height` node.

I used the R channel of the Vertex Color to ensure that the starting few vertices of the waterfall mesh was not affected by the vertex displacement, ensuring that the waterfall itself is immersive.

The mesh was created by extruding a cube and adding multiple subdivisions so that the resulting vertex displacement from the shader does not feel "choppy" in a way. I had to unwrap the UV in such a way that the back portion of the mesh mirrors the front portion since the gradient noise used for the vertex displacement is procedural and not seamless. By mirroring the UVs, I can "fake" the seamless displacement.

### Interactive Water
The final aspect of the diorama is to add water interaction the moment the player enters the water. By referencing a tutorial created by [MinionsArt](https://www.patreon.com/minionsart), I was able to create the interactive water by writing a <mark>script</mark> and using <mark>Unity's Particle System</mark>.
